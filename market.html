      <h2>Paharganj</h2><br>
      <p>As you step out of the New Delhi Railway Station and cross the road, you stand at the entrance of Paharganj Main Bazaar. Stretching for about a kilometre, it is a bargainer's paradise. Chaotic, noisy and dirty, the market is only for shoppers who are rough and tough.

        The whole Main Bazaar is lined with shops full to the brim with books, music, jewellery, bags, clothes, shoes, incense, textiles, wooden statues, and handicrafts. Shanti Handloom and other textile shops offer bags, bed spreads, cushion covers, wall hangings, etc. The jewellery shops sell handmade beaded necklaces and bangles in every shape, size and colour. Carved wooden statues of gods and goddesses, brass wares and decorations are available among handicrafts. Prayer Incense Worldwide specializes in incense sticks, incense cones and Indian tea. Even books, both new and second-hand, are available.</p><br>
